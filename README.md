# Age-and-Gender-detection-system<br>
This repository contains a deep learning model for predicting the age and gender of individuals using the UTKFace dataset. The model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and utilizes the concept of epochs for training.<br>

### Dataset<br>
The UTKFace dataset is a widely-used dataset for age and gender prediction tasks. It contains facial images of individuals along with their corresponding age and gender labels. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle. The UTKFace dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new).<br>
. Please download and extract the dataset before running the model.<br>

### Model Architecture<br>
The age and gender prediction model is built using a CNN architecture. It consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by fully connected layers and output layers for age and gender prediction. The model is trained using the UTKFace dataset to learn patterns and features from facial images.
